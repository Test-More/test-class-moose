=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you need the functionality of L<Test::Class::Moose> to be available inside
of a role, this is the module to do that. This is how you can declare a TCM
role:

    package TestsFor::Basic::Role;

    use Test::Class::Moose::Role;

    sub test_in_a_role {
        my $test = shift;

        pass "This is picked up from role";
    }


    sub in_a_role_with_tags : Tags(first){
        fail "We should never see this test";
    }


    sub test_in_a_role_with_tags : Tags(second){
        pass "We should see this test";
    }

    1;

And to consume it:

    package TestsFor::Basic::WithRole;
    use Test::Class::Moose;

    with qw/TestsFor::Basic::Role/;

    sub test_in_withrole {
        pass "Got here";
    }

    1;

Note that this cannot be consumed into classes and magically make them into
test classes. You must still (at the present time) inherit from
C<Test::Class::Moose> to create a test suite.

=head2 Skipping Test::Most

By default, when you C<use Test::Class::Moose::Role> in your own test class, it
exports all the subs from L<Test::Most> into your class. If you'd prefer to
import a different set of test tools, you can pass C<< bare => 1 >> when using
C<Test::Class::Moose::Role>:

 use Test::Class::Moose::Role bare => 1;

 When you pass this, C<Test::Class::Moose::Role> will not export L<Test::Most>'s subs
 into your class. You will have to explicitly import something like
 L<Test::More> or L<Test2::Tools::Compare> in order to actually perform tests.
