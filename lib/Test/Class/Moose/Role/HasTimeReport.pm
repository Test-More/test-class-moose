=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<time>

Returns a L<Test::Class::Moose::Report::Time> object. This object represents
the duration of this class or method. The duration may be "0" if it's an
abstract class with no tests run.

=head2 C<start_time>

Returns the start time for the report as an epoch value.

=head2 C<end_time>

Returns the end time for the report as an epoch value.
