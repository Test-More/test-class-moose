=head1 NAME

Test::Class::Moose - Test::Class + Moose

=head1 VERSION

0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package TestsFor::Some::Class;
 use Test::Class::Moose;

 sub test_me {
     my $test  = shift;
     my $class = $test->this_class;
     ok 1, "test_me() ran ($class)";
     ok 2, "this is another test ($class)";
 }

 sub test_this_baby {
     my $test  = shift;
     my $class = $test->this_class;
     is 2, 2, "whee! ($class)";
 }

 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is B<ALPHA> code. It is not production ready, but the basics seem to work
well.

This is a tiny proof of concept for writing Test::Class-style tests with
Moose. Better docs will come later. You should already know how to use Moose
and Test::Class.

=head1 BASICS

=head2 Inheriting from Test::Class::Moose

Just C<use Test::Class::Moose>. That's all. You'll get all L<Test::Most> test
functions, too, along with C<strict> and C<warnings>. You can use all L<Moose>
behavior, too.

=head2 Declare a test method

All method names that begin with C<test_> are test methods. Methods that do
not are not test methods.

 sub test_this_is_a_method {
     my $test = shift;

     $test->this_is_not_a_test_method;
     ok 1, 'whee!';
 }

 sub this_is_not_a_test_method {
    my $test = shift;
    # but you can, of course, call it like normal
 }

=head2 Plans

No plans needed. The test suite declares a plan of the number of test classes.

Each test class is a subtest declaring a plan of the number of test methods.

Each test method relies on an implicit C<done_testing> call.

=head2 Inheriting from another Test::Class::Moose class

List it as the C<extends> (or C<parent>) in the import list.

 package TestsFor::Some::Class::Subclass;
 use Test::Class::Moose extends => 'TestsFor::Some::Class';

 sub test_me {
     my $test  = shift;
     my $class = $test->this_class;
     ok 1, "I overrode my parent! ($class)";
 }

 before 'test_this_baby' => sub {
     my $test  = shift;
     my $class = $test->this_class;
     pass "This should run before my parent method ($class)";
 };

 sub this_should_not_run {
     my $test = shift;
     fail "We should never see this test";
 }

 sub test_this_should_be_run {
     for ( 1 .. 5 ) {
         pass "This is test number $_ in this method";
     }
 }

 1;

=head1 TEST CONTROL METHODS

Do not run tests in test control methods. They are not needed and in the
future, will cause test failures. If a test control method fails, the
class/method should fail. Currently we do not trap exceptions, so your entire
test suite will break. Yes, this is a bug and will be fixed later.

These are:

=over 4

=item * C<test_startup>

Runs at the start of each test class

=item * C<test_setup>

Runs at the start of each test method

=item * C<test_teardown>

Runs at the end of each test method

=item * C<test_shutdown>

Runs at the end of each test class

=back

To override a test control method, just remember that this is OO:

 sub test_setup {
     my $test = shift;
     $test->next::method; # optional to call parent test_setup
     # more setup code here
 }

=head1 RUNNING THE TEST SUITE

We have a constructor now:

 use Test::Class::Moose::Load 't/lib';
 Test::Class::Moose->new->runtests

Attributes to it:

=over 4

=item * C<show_timing>

Boolean. Will display verbose information on the amount of time it takes each
test class/test method to run.

=item * C<statistics>

Boolean. Will display number of classes, test methods and tests run.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<builder>

 my $builder = $test->builder;

Returns the Test::Builder object.

=head2 C<this_class>

 my $class = $test->this_class;

Returns the name for this class. Useful if you rebless an object (such as
applying a role at runtime) and lose the original class name.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<get_test_classes>

You may override this in a subclass. Currently returns a sorted list of all
loaded classes that inherit directly or indirectly through
C<Test::Class::Moose>

=head2 C<get_test_methods>

You may override this in a subclass. Currently returns all methods in a test
class that start with C<test_> (except for the test control methods).

=head1 SAMPLE TAP OUTPUT

We use nested tests (subtests) at each level:

    1..2
    # 
    # Executing tests for TestsFor::Basic::Subclass
    # 
        1..3
        # TestsFor::Basic::Subclass->test_me()
            ok 1 - I overrode my parent! (TestsFor::Basic::Subclass)
            1..1
        ok 1 - test_me
        # TestsFor::Basic::Subclass->test_this_baby()
            ok 1 - This should run before my parent method (TestsFor::Basic::Subclass)
            ok 2 - whee! (TestsFor::Basic::Subclass)
            1..2
        ok 2 - test_this_baby
        # TestsFor::Basic::Subclass->test_this_should_be_run()
            ok 1 - This is test number 1 in this method
            ok 2 - This is test number 2 in this method
            ok 3 - This is test number 3 in this method
            ok 4 - This is test number 4 in this method
            ok 5 - This is test number 5 in this method
            1..5
        ok 3 - test_this_should_be_run
    ok 1 - TestsFor::Basic::Subclass
    # 
    # Executing tests for TestsFor::Basic
    # 
        1..2
        # TestsFor::Basic->test_me()
            ok 1 - test_me() ran (TestsFor::Basic)
            ok 2 - this is another test (TestsFor::Basic)
            1..2
        ok 1 - test_me
        # TestsFor::Basic->test_this_baby()
            ok 1 - whee! (TestsFor::Basic)
            1..1
        ok 2 - test_this_baby
    ok 2 - TestsFor::Basic
    # Test classes:    2
    # Test methods:    5
    # Total tests run: 11
    ok
    All tests successful.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Add C<Test::Class::Moose::Reporting>

Gather up the reporting in one module rather than doing it on an ad-hoc basis.

=item * Test method filtering

 Test::Class::Moose->new({
     include => qr/customer/,
     exclude => qr/database/,
 })->runtests;

=item * Load classes

 Test::Class::Moose->new({
    load => sub {
        my $test  = shift;
        my $class = $test->this_class;
        $class    =~ s/^TestsFor:://;
        return $class;
    },
 })->runtests;
 
If present, takes a sub that returns a classname we'll attempt to
automatically load. Completely optional, of course. And then in your test:

 sub test_something {
     my $test   = shift;
     my $class  = $test->class_to_test;
     my $object = $class->new;
     ok ...
 }

Because it's an attribute, you can merely declare it in a subclass, if you
prefer, or override it in a subclass (in other words, this is OO code and you,
the developer, will have full control over it).

=item * Pass class/methd names to test control methods

=item * Make it easy to skip an entire class
